  title: Sample Password Flow OAuth2 Project
  description: This is an example of using OAuth2 Password Flow in a specification to describe security to your API.

# Under securityDefinitions we declare which security schemes can be used.
# These definitions do not affect to the operations, but can be applied
# using the 'security' key at the global level or the operation level.
# In this sample, we'll see how to apply the security definition globally,
# and override it at the operation level.
#
# Note that for Password Flow, you must provide the Token URL.
securityDefinitions:
  password:
    type: oauth2
    # This should be updated to the Token URL of your OAuth provider.
    tokenUrl: http://example.com/oauth/token
    flow: password
    scopes:
      write: allows modifying resources
      read: allows reading resources

# Here we apply the security flow called 'password' globally to all the operations in the spec.
# This security scheme is defined above in the 'securityDefinitions' section.
# Global security can be overridden an operation level as seen in the example below
security:
  - password:
      - read
      - write
paths:
  /example:
    # In this operation we do not apply the security, because it was applied globally above.
    # The security will be applied to this operation for that reason.

    get:
      summary: Server heartbeat operation
      description: This operation shows how to override the global security defined above, as we want to open it up for all users.
      # We want to require no security schemes and override the globally define security scheme.
      # To do that, we simply provide an empty array to the 'security' property.
